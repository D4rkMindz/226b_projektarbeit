## What is Gracili?

Gracili is a PHP Application Template to quickly create a new Project.
Using this template can save you a lot of time. With the [Slim PHP](https://www.slimframework.com/) Framework is a fast and simple base provided to easily extend your application to grow with the required workload.

## Installation

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/D4rkMindz/gracili/releases) of Gracili and extract it to the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) htdocs-folder.
You need to run the [composer](https://getcomposer.org) installation command once after the extraction to install all required libraries

```bash
$ composer install
```

There are usually many environments that your application is installed (you should not develop on the productive server ;) ). There is a environment configuration file to solve the problem with different configurations and password per environment.
You have to rename the `config/env.example.php` file to `config/env.php` and  fill in your data.
If the `config/env.php` file is not found, the application will look for it in the parent directory (most probably the htdocs folder in your xampp environment). If the `env.php` file is not found there, the application will throw an Error.
You can also define a `APP_ENV` environment variable and add a `<APP_ENV>.php` file in the `config/` folder to specify public configurations for e.g. your [CI Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (NOT PASSWORD OR ANY SECRETS)

Gracili is now successfully installed and ready to work on.

Afterwards you can start your local Apache Server with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
To visit your Website you have to open http://localhost/<project_directory>/.

## Structure

The Gracili Application Template is build on the [MVC Design Pattern](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller). All source code should be in the `src/` directory.

| Folder            | Content                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/`         | All files required for the configuration of your application                                                                           |
| `public/`         | Static accessible web files (images, css, fonts, etc.)                                                                                 |
| `resources/`      | Other resources, that should not be public (migrations or translations)                                                                |
| `src/`            | All PHP source code (The App namespace)                                                                                                |
| `src/Controller/` | Directory for all Controllers (one per 'page')                                                                                         |
| `src/Datarow/`    | Classes for the Database sets that are returend and hydrated (one per 'select')                                                        |
| `src/Service/`    | All services for the businesslogic are here. It is recommended to structure it [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) |
| `src/Table/`      | The classes for the database queries (one per 'table')                                                                                 |
| `src/Util/`       | Helper classes like a validation context.                                                                                              |
| `templates/`      | The [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) template files                                                                                   |
| `tests/`          | Directory for tests                                                                                                                    |
| `temp/`           | Temporary files (logfiles, cache)                                                                                                      |

Afterwards you can start your local Apache Server with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
To visit your Website you have to open http://localhost/<project_directory>/.

## Running the tests

Supposing, that you have [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) installed, just run the following command to run all PHPUnit tests

```bash
$ ant phpunit
```

### Running the tests with coverage

Run the following command to generate a coverage file in the generated build folder `build/logs/clover.xml`

```bash
$ ant phpunit-coverage
```

### Running single test files

To run just a few tests, not the whole test suite, you can run the following command after you added the `@group actual` annotation to the test class docblock

```bash
$ ant phpunit-actual
```

The test class doc block to run the test in the actual group must look like this

```php
/**
 * My test class
 * @group actual
 */
class MyTest
{
  // PHPUnit Test here ...
}
```
